# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

All versions of this repo are currently supported, but this may change in the future. If so, I will make sure to update the table below. It will probably be around 5 new versions before support for the oldest supported edition is removed.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.1+  | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Although I have a linked email address in my profile, it is often clogged so that is definitely not the best way to privately message me.
Please never report security vulnerabilities publicly in issues or comments as obviously that's just highlighting the problem to everybody.
Instead, please always report these to either my Reddit (u/DevilJamJar) or to my Discord (DevilJamJar#0001) where I will respond pretty quickly.
